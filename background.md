# CISC367H Final Project - Background
## Title: The State of Workers' Mental Health in the Tech Industry
### Problem 
This data exploration will address the problem of society's worsening mental health in the context of workers in the tech industry. 
### Background
10% of the global burden of disease is attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders. The leading contributors to years lived with disability are mental, neurological, and substance use disorders [(Global Mental Health, APA)](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/international/global-mental-health). More locally, mental health in the United States continues to pose threats to people's wellbeing. Among adults, the prevalance of mental illness is increasing, suicidal ideation is increasing, and treatment is inaccessible [(Mental Health America)](https://www.mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america). These statistics prove that we need to pay attention to mental health in our communities. 

Reports have found that the tech industry's workplace culture tends to be less supportive of marginalized communities, including women [(Washington State Labor Education and Research Center and SEIU)](https://georgetown.southseattle.edu/sites/georgetown.southseattle.edu/files/2020-10/GenderDivideInTech-Final%5B5146%5D_1.pdf) and people of color [(Anil Dash)](http://anildash.com/2007/02/23/the_old_boys_cl/). In the summer of 2014, many notable tech companies including Google, Yahoo, and Facebook reported remarkably low statistics regarding a diverse staff and committed to do better. According to their Diversity Annual Report, as of 2020, Google's employees were 68% male and 54% white [(Google)](https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/25badfc6b6d1b33f3b87372ff7545d79261520d821e6ee9a82c4ab2de42a01216be2156bc5a60ae3337ffe7176d90b8b2b3000891ac6e516a650ecebf0e3f866). Have these companies really delivered on their promises? 

Krieger et al. found that class, race, and gender inequities in the healthcare workplace lead to risk of socially hazardous experiences [(International Journal of Health Services)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16524165/). Do these findings transcend the type of workplace? Socially isolating experiences can affect workers' mental health [(Journal of Interpersonal Violence)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260508317182). How do these experiences affect workers specifically in the tech industry? 

[Mental Health America](https://www.mhanational.org/blog/how-company-culture-may-be-impacting-your-mental-health) explored how company culture can impact employees' mental health. Emphasis was placed on the value of open and safe communication as well as a communicative managerial style. However, nsiders have reported that the tech industry upholds unhealthy workforce habits [(Wharton UPenn)](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/silicon-valley-work-culture/). Among tech workers in China, controversy has risen regarding '996' culture. '996' culture is the expectation of Chinese workers from some tech companies to work from 9am to 9pm six days a week [(NY Times)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/technology/china-996-jack-ma.html). How do these industry standards affect workers' mental health? 

### Data used 
I will be analyzing the [SMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016?select=osmi-survey-2016_1479139902.json) dataset. In 2016, this survey was offered to workers worldwide in the tech industry. Questions include demographics such as age, gender, location, as well as treatment of mental health in the industry such as employers' discussion of mental health benefits, participants' comfort of disclosing about mental health conditions, and any mental health conditions participants felt comfortable sharing. 

### Research Questions
These research questions aim to narrow down the answer to general question of what factors affect mental health perceptions and conditions in the tech industry? 
1. **Do workers' perceptions of mental health differ by country?**

    Given the global issue of mental health discussed [earlier](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/international/global-mental-health), mental health is persistent among cultures. The World Health Organization is increasing investment to mental health resources [(WHO)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/mental-health#tab=tab_1). It is interesting to wonder if culture affects the perception of mental health. By analyzing survey responses based on participants' locations, I can investigate cultural differences. Findings may suggest different needs for mental health resources based on the state of mental health in different cultures. Findings may also lead to investigations into different countries' workplace cultures to understand adaptive and maladaptive aspects of the industry. 

2. **Do workers' perceptions of mental health differ by gender?**
    
    As discussed [earlier](https://georgetown.southseattle.edu/sites/georgetown.southseattle.edu/files/2020-10/GenderDivideInTech-Final%5B5146%5D_1.pdf), women tend to have different experiences than men in the tech workforce. Is there a correlation between gender and how workers experience conditions around mental health in their employment? Results may suggest the importance of challenging normal gender dynamics or changing how gender dynamics are currently treated in industry. 

3. **Do workers' perceptions of mental health differ by age/generation?**

    Research suggests that members of different generations identify and conceptualize mental health and mental illness differenty [(APA)](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/gen-z) [(Avera, Georgia Southern University)](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1346&context=honors-theses). It is common for concepts to evolve from generation to generation. Analyzing responses based on age may provide insight into points of contention among workers, or between workers and employers. 


### Ethical concerns, considerations, or ramifications 

Mental health is a sensitive topic to approach. An ethical concern is that analyzing people's mental health in the context of their work may minimize their value as individuals, perpetuating the harmful conflation of people as workers. Many of the countries represented in this survey data are capitalist, and I consider this factor worth the risk of the acknowledged ethical concern. Capitalism does not seem to be going anywhere, and analyzing the experience of people in the workforce may offer insight into supporting their experience and challenging barriers of the existing system. Regardless, in my reporting of the data I will be intentional in honoring that these perspectives come from individuals with jobs in the tech industry who maintain livelihoods beyond their work that may have affected their responses.

Another ethical concern regarding the sensitive nature of mental health is its treatment in the workplace. The data includes questions regarding the discussion of mental health in the workplace from employers. Althought employers discussing mental health and mental health benefits is generally seen as a good thing, discussing the topic may be upsetting to people in the work setting. This topic must be approached with sensitivity and any suggestions from the results must be handled carefully.
